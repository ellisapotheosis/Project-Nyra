# Canonical Project Context

## Project family

Project Nyra / RateHunter / Project Apotheosis-adjacent AI infrastructure.

## Mission

Build a distributed AI mortgage operating system that combines lead capture, CRM, mortgage quoting, campaign automation, AI assistant workflows, local GPU inference, memory systems, and a unified broker command center. The platform should convert mortgage/real-estate leads into managed borrower journeys while giving Ellis a secure, high-leverage command layer over CRM, campaigns, quotes, agent tasks, and infrastructure.

## Business purpose

Nyra is intended to become a revenue-generating mortgage automation platform: ingest leads, normalize/contact them, quote them, nurture them for 45–60+ days, stop appropriately on replies/opt-outs, sync statuses to TwentyCRM, and surface all important work through a command-center webapp. It should reduce manual follow-up, improve response speed, and provide an AI-assisted operational layer for mortgage brokerage work.

## Core product surfaces

- Public RateHunter landing page and lead-capture funnel.
- Internal RateHunter/Nyra webapp command center.
- TwentyCRM as the CRM/system-of-record surface or linked CRM backend.
- Campaign builder and campaign status surfaces.
- Quote desk / quote engine surface.
- Agent/operator console for OpenClaw/Nerve/Paperclip/ClawTeam and infrastructure tools.
- Automation surfaces for n8n, Activepieces, Composio, Twilio, SendGrid, and webhooks.
- Memory/knowledge surfaces for Letta/Mem0/FalkorDB/Graphiti/OpenMemory-derived components, with final memory architecture treated as a conflict/default decision.

## Canonical production topology default

| Node | Role | Default services |
|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | Local CPU control plane / low-latency command center | OpenClaw gateways, Nerve UIs, ClawTeam server, LiteLLM, Nexus/Hive MCP gateway, WaveTerm/Zellij control, Cloudflared where local routing is required |
| `worker-rtx5090` | Heavy inference / coding / complex mortgage reasoning | vLLM OpenAI-compatible server, LMCache/Redis cache, ClawTeam node, optional voice/agent worker profile |
| `worker-rtx3090ti` | Secondary/steady inference / production agent workload | vLLM or Ollama endpoint, LMCache/Redis, ClawTeam node, lead parsing/normalization workload |
| `worker-rtx3060` | Utility GPU node | Embeddings, small Ollama models, STT/TTS/voice utilities, vector preprocessing, lightweight background tasks |
| `oracle-vps` | Always-on cloud plane / public webhooks / durable automation | n8n, Activepieces, Gitea, Letta/Mem0/FalkorDB/Postgres/Redis as selected, SearXNG, Browserless, Traefik/Nginx/Cloudflared, public webhook receiver |

## Critical implementation stance

The cleanest default is **split brain / split muscle**:

- UI, routing, orchestration, and durable public webhook endpoints live on CPU/cloud nodes.
- Raw GPU inference lives on GPU workers.
- Browser-facing apps talk to server-side APIs/proxies; secrets remain server-side.
- The webapp may embed or link specialist tools, but mortgage-critical workflows should eventually be broker-safe wrapper pages rather than raw admin UIs.
- UI/design specifics are intentionally quarantined from implementation until the Claude Desktop design pass is complete.
