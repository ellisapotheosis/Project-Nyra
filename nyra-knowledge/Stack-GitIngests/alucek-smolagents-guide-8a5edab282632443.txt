# smolagents: Building Intelligent AI Agents with Open Source LLMs

<img src="./media/smolagents.jpg" width=600>

From the developers at Hugging Face comes [smolagents](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents), a powerful yet streamlined framework for building AI agent systems using open source large language models. The framework emphasizes simplicity while providing a robust, modular, and scalable approach to agentic llm system design.

**Key Features:**
- Native integration with [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) ecosystem 
- Local deployment support via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- Cloud flexibility through [HuggingFace API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index)
- Broad model compatibility via [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/) and OpenAI API specs

Resources: [Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/index) | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/tree/main)
