## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**For Vault Management and CLI tools:**

- [Bitwarden CLI](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/) installed (ex. `npm install -g @bitwarden/cli`)
- Node.js 22+
- Bitwarden account

**For Organization Administration:**

- Node.js 22+
- Bitwarden Teams or Enterprise organization
- Organization owner or admin permissions

### Configuration

> [!WARNING]
> The configuration files below will contain sensitive credentials that grant access to your Bitwarden vault. Keep these files secure, never commit them to version control, and never share them with others. Ensure your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) is configured to run the server locally only.

#### Option 1: Claude Desktop (Recommended)

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bitwarden": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@bitwarden/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "BW_SESSION": "your-session-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Get your session token:**

```bash
bw login
bw unlock --raw
```

To enable organization administration features, add API credentials:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bitwarden": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@bitwarden/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "BW_SESSION": "your-session-token-here",
        "BW_CLIENT_ID": "organization.your-client-id",
        "BW_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Get organization API credentials:**

1. Go to your Bitwarden Web Vault
2. Navigate to your organization → Settings → My Organization
3. Scroll to "API Key" section
4. Click "View API Key" and authenticate

#### Option 2: Locally Built and Referenced

Requires that this repository be checked out locally. Once that's done:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then reference the built `dist/index.js` file from Claude desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bitwarden": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["local/path/to/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BW_SESSION": "your-session-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Other MCP Clients

Any MCP-compatible client can connect to this server via stdio transport. Refer to your client's documentation for configuration details.

## Development

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitwarden/mcp-server.git
cd mcp-server
npm install
```

### Commands

```bash
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
npm test             # Run test suite
npm run lint         # Check code style
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run inspect      # Test with MCP Inspector
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector provides an interactive testing environment:

```bash
npm run build
npm run inspect
```

This opens a web interface where you can:

- Browse available tools
- Test tool execution with custom inputs
- View request/response payloads
- Debug tool behavior

### Best Practices

- Store credentials securely (use system keychains or environment managers)
- Rotate session tokens regularly
- Review audit logs periodically for suspicious activity
- Never commit credentials to version control

### Testing

The project includes Jest unit tests covering validation, CLI commands, and core functionality.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test validation.spec.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="validation"
```

### Debugging

**Enable debug logging** by setting environment variables:

```bash
export DEBUG=bitwarden:*
export NODE_ENV=development
```

## Security considerations

- **Never commit** sensitive credentials (`BW_SESSION`, `BW_CLIENT_ID`, `BW_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- **Validate all inputs** using Zod schemas (already implemented)
- **Test with non-production data** when possible
- **Monitor API usage** through your organization's audit logs
- Understand the security and privacy impacts of exposing sensitive vault data to LLM and AI tools. Using a self-hosted or local LLM may be appropriate, for example.

## Troubleshooting

### CLI Issues

- **Vault is locked**

  ```bash
  bw unlock --raw
  # Copy the token and update BW_SESSION in your MCP config
  ```

- **Session key is invalid**
  - Session tokens expire after inactivity
  - Run `bw unlock --raw` to get a fresh token
  - Update your MCP configuration with the new token

### API Issues

- **Invalid client credentials**
  - Verify `BW_CLIENT_ID` starts with `organization.`
  - Ensure `BW_CLIENT_SECRET` is correct
  - Check that API keys haven't been rotated in the Admin Console

- **403 Forbidden**
  - Verify you have organization owner or admin permissions
  - Some operations require specific roles (e.g., managing members)
