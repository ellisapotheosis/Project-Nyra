# Current Context

## Active Development Focus

- Translation and internationalization (i18n) tools integration

## Critical Operational Notes

**NEVER START THE MCP SERVER MANUALLY**
- The MCP server is ALWAYS running automatically in this repository
- Do not use `npm run mcp` or similar commands
- Any attempt to manually start the server will cause conflicts and errors

## Recent Changes

- Added a new `findUntranslated.ts` tool
- Uncommented i18n tools in the main tools index file
