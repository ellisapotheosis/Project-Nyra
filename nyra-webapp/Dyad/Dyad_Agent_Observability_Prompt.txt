# Agent Observability & Control Panel
Goal: a dashboard to watch and steer multi-agent behavior (cloud + local GPUs).

## UI
- Top: agent grid cards (Lead Intake, Classifier, Scheduler, Comms, Quotes, Orchestrator).
- Center: live event stream (events, inbound STOPs, errors) with filters.
- Right: controls (pause campaign sends, drain queue, retry failed).
- Modal: dependency graph (Mermaid) fed by a `/agents/graph` endpoint.

## Backend
- Emit OpenTelemetry spans from each module; collect minimal metrics (events sent/min, failures).
- Redis metrics: queue sizes, active jobs.
- `POST /control/{agent}/{cmd}` for pause/resume/drain; guard with owner role.
- Log to `agent_logs` table; stream via WS.

## Hosting
- Put this under `dev.domain.com/ops`, behind auth. Use Coolify to deploy and keep it near Redis and the scheduler.
