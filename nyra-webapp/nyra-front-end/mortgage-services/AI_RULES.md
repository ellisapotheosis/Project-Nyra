# AI Development Rules

This document outlines the technology stack and specific library usage guidelines for this Next.js application. Adhering to these rules will help maintain consistency, improve collaboration, and ensure the AI assistant can effectively understand and modify the codebase.

## Tech Stack Overview

The application is built using the following core technologies:

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
  
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose for local development and consistent environments.
  
- **Container Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) for hosting Docker images.
  
- **Language**: TypeScript
  
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI - A collection of re-usable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
  
- **Icons**: Lucide React - A comprehensive library of simply beautiful SVG icons.
  
- **Forms**: React Hook Form for managing form state and validation, typically with Zod for schema validation.
  
- **Database**: JSON database (`lowdb`) - A lightweight, file-based database that runs entirely in JavaScript.
  
- **State Management**: Primarily React Context API and built-in React hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`).
  
- **Notifications/Toasts**: Sonner for displaying non-intrusive notifications.
  
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization.
  
- **Animation**: `tailwindcss-animate` and animation capabilities built into Radix UI components.
  
- **API Proxying**: Next.js Rewrites for handling external API integrations and bypassing CORS.
  

## Library Usage Guidelines

To ensure consistency and leverage the chosen stack effectively, please follow these rules:

1. **UI Components**:
  
  - **Primary Choice**: Always prioritize using components from the `src/components/ui/` directory (Shadcn/UI components).
    
  - **Custom Components**: If a required component is not available in Shadcn/UI, create a new component in `src/components/` following Shadcn/UI's composition patterns (i.e., building on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS).
    
  - **Avoid**: Introducing new, third-party UI component libraries without discussion.
    
2. **Styling**:
  
  - **Primary Choice**: Exclusively use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all styling.
    
  - **Global Styles**: Reserve `src/app/globals.css` for base Tailwind directives, global CSS variable definitions, and minimal base styling. Avoid adding component-specific styles here.
    
  - **CSS-in-JS**: Do not use CSS-in-JS libraries (e.g., Styled Components, Emotion).
    
3. **Icons**:
  
  - **Primary Choice**: Use icons from the `lucide-react` library.
4. **Forms**:
  
  - **Management**: Use `react-hook-form` for all form logic (state, validation, submission).
    
  - **Validation**: Use `zod` for schema-based validation with `react-hook-form` via `@hookform/resolvers`.
    
5. **Database (JSON Database with `lowdb`)**:
  
  - **Integration**: Interact with the JSON database directly using the **`lowdb` library** via the utility functions in `src/lib/database.ts`.
    
  - **Schema Extension**: The `DbSchema` interface in `src/lib/database.database.ts` defines the structure of the JSON database. **When a user requests to store new types of data, the AI MUST extend this `DbSchema` interface by adding new properties (e.g., `myCustomData: { ... }[]`) and initialize them as empty arrays/objects in the `Low` constructor's default data.**
    
  - **Persistence**: Any changes to the database (adding, updating, deleting data by modifying `db.data`) **must be explicitly persisted to the `db.json` file by calling `await db.write()`** after the modification.
    
  - **Initialization**: The `db.json` file and its initial structure (`{ examples: [] }`) are automatically created with default empty data when the application first starts, so no manual database setup commands are required.
    
  - **Database File**: The `db.json` file is expected to reside in the `/app/data/` directory (or a directory specified by `DATABASE_DIR` environment variable) within the Docker container for persistence via volume mapping.
    
6. **State Management**:
  
  - **Local State**: Use React's `useState` and `useReducer` hooks for component-level state.
    
  - **Shared/Global State**: For state shared between multiple components, prefer React Context API.
    
  - **Complex Global State**: If application state becomes significantly complex, discuss the potential introduction of a dedicated state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai) before implementing.
    
7. **Routing**:
  
  - Utilize the Next.js App Router (file-system based routing in the `src/app/` directory).
8. **API Calls & Data Fetching**:
  
  - **Client-Side**: Use the native `fetch` API or a simple wrapper around it.
    
  - **Server-Side (Next.js)**: Leverage Next.js Route Handlers (in `src/app/api/`) or Server Actions for server-side logic and data fetching.
    
  - **External API Proxying**: When interacting with external APIs that have CORS issues, route requests through Next.js API Rewrites as configured in `next.config.ts` (e.g., `/api/service1/*`). Avoid direct client-side calls to external APIs without proxying unless explicitly necessary.
    
  - **Adding New Proxies & Environment Variables**: **When a user requests integration with a new external API, the AI MUST:**
    
    1. **Add a new environment variable** (e.g., `THIRD_PARTY_API_URL`) to the `.env` file (if not already present).
      
    2. **Add a corresponding new rewrite rule in `next.config.ts`** for that specific API.
      
    3. **Crucially, add the new environment variable (commented out, as an example) to the `environment` section of the `web` service in `docker-compose.yml`**. This ensures the Docker Compose setup is ready for local development with the new feature.
      
    4. Server-side API routes should then use this new environment variable to directly fetch from the external API, while client-side components can use the proxied path.
      
  - **ðŸš© CRITICAL PITFALL: Server-Side External API Calls ðŸš©**: **The AI MUST ABSOLUTELY NOT use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` or the application's own `/api` proxy path (e.g., `/api/3rd_party/data`) for server-side fetches to** ***external*** **APIs.** Server-side routes run in the Node.js environment and **MUST directly access external services** using their dedicated server-side environment variables (e.g., `process.env.THIRD_PARTY_API_URL`). The `/api` proxy paths are specifically designed and intended only for client-side requests to bypass CORS.
    
9. **Animations**:
  
  - Use `tailwindcss-animate` plugin and the animation utilities provided by Radix UI components.
10. **Notifications/Toasts**:
  
  - Use the `Sonner` component (from `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx`) for all toast notifications.
11. **Charts & Data Visualization**:
  
  - Use `recharts` and its associated components (e.g., `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`) for displaying charts.
12. **Utility Functions**:
  
  - General-purpose helper functions should be placed in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
    
  - Ensure functions are well-typed and serve a clear, reusable purpose.
    
13. **Custom Hooks**:
  
  - Custom React hooks should be placed in the `src/hooks/` directory (e.g., `src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx`).
14. **TypeScript**:
  
  - Write all new code in TypeScript.
    
  - Strive for strong typing and leverage TypeScript's features to improve code quality and maintainability. Avoid using `any` where possible.
    
  - **Absolute Imports**: **The AI MUST use absolute imports for modules within the `src` directory** (e.g., `import { getDb } from 'lib/database';` instead of `import { getDb } from '../../lib/database';`). Next.js automatically configures path aliases (e.g., `@/` maps to `src/`) for improved module resolution. **Therefore, imports should be structured like `import { MyComponent } from '@/components/MyComponent';` or `import { myUtility } from '@/lib/utils';`.** This enhances module resolution robustness, especially in Docker environments, and improves code readability.
    
15. **Environment Variables for Dyad Testing**:
  
  - For testing and development within the Dyad environment, users can set environment variables directly through the Dyad UI. **It is critical to instruct the user to set any necessary environment variables (e.g., for external API URLs like `THIRD_PARTY_API_URL` or database directories like `DATABASE_DIR`) within the Dyad UI's environment variable settings.** These variables will then be available to the running Next.js application, allowing for quick iteration before pushing to a Docker-based deployment. The AI should remind the user to set these when relevant.

By following these guidelines, we can build a more robust, maintainable, and consistent application within the Dockerized Next.js ecosystem.
