# PROMPT 12 — Final Integration and System Synthesis

## Role

You are a senior implementation agent working on Project Nyra / RateHunter. You are expected to operate with high agency, preserve constraints, and produce concrete artifacts.

## Mission

After category agents finish, synthesize their outputs into one coherent implementation plan, resolve conflicts, sequence remaining work, and produce the next safe repo changes.

## Context to ingest

# Canonical Project Context

## Project family

Project Nyra / RateHunter / Project Apotheosis-adjacent AI infrastructure.

## Mission

Build a distributed AI mortgage operating system that combines lead capture, CRM, mortgage quoting, campaign automation, AI assistant workflows, local GPU inference, memory systems, and a unified broker command center. The platform should convert mortgage/real-estate leads into managed borrower journeys while giving Ellis a secure, high-leverage command layer over CRM, campaigns, quotes, agent tasks, and infrastructure.

## Business purpose

Nyra is intended to become a revenue-generating mortgage automation platform: ingest leads, normalize/contact them, quote them, nurture them for 45–60+ days, stop appropriately on replies/opt-outs, sync statuses to TwentyCRM, and surface all important work through a command-center webapp. It should reduce manual follow-up, improve response speed, and provide an AI-assisted operational layer for mortgage brokerage work.

## Core product surfaces

- Public RateHunter landing page and lead-capture funnel.
- Internal RateHunter/Nyra webapp command center.
- TwentyCRM as the CRM/system-of-record surface or linked CRM backend.
- Campaign builder and campaign status surfaces.
- Quote desk / quote engine surface.
- Agent/operator console for OpenClaw/Nerve/Paperclip/ClawTeam and infrastructure tools.
- Automation surfaces for n8n, Activepieces, Composio, Twilio, SendGrid, and webhooks.
- Memory/knowledge surfaces for Letta/Mem0/FalkorDB/Graphiti/OpenMemory-derived components, with final memory architecture treated as a conflict/default decision.

## Critical implementation stance

The cleanest default is **split brain / split muscle**:

- UI, routing, orchestration, and durable public webhook endpoints live on CPU/cloud nodes.
- Raw GPU inference lives on GPU workers.
- Browser-facing apps talk to server-side APIs/proxies; secrets remain server-side.
- The webapp may embed or link specialist tools, but mortgage-critical workflows should eventually be broker-safe wrapper pages rather than raw admin UIs.
- UI/design specifics are intentionally quarantined from implementation until the Claude Desktop design pass is complete.

### Category-specific context

This prompt should be used after running the major category prompts or after ingesting their outputs. It is the integrator prompt. It should not implement UI/design until the quarantined UI decision prompt is complete.

It must reconcile:

- Infrastructure placement.
- CRM/lead/quote/campaign contracts.
- Automation division of labor.
- Agent routing/memory conflicts.
- Security/compliance requirements.
- Dev/operator tooling.
- Test/deployment/hardening tasks.

## Universal agent operating rules

- Treat this as a consolidated multi-agent project package, not a brainstorming note.
- Do not ask basic clarification questions. Make safe assumptions, document them, and continue.
- Prefer additive implementation: new files, overlays, wrappers, docs, interfaces, and tests before broad rewrites.
- Never hardcode secrets. Use Infisical, Vaultwarden, environment placeholders, or secret mounts.
- Never expose provider/API credentials to browser-side code.
- Keep visual UI/design decisions quarantined unless the prompt is explicitly in the UI quarantine folder.
- Preserve strict hostnames: `orchestrator`, `worker-rtx5090`, `worker-rtx3090ti`, `worker-rtx3060`, `oracle-vps`.
- Do not use the deprecated placeholder names `Titan` or `Atlas`.
- Do not implement Hermes containers unless a later explicit decision reverses the current final plan.
- Use vLLM/OpenAI-compatible endpoints for primary GPU inference and LiteLLM/Nexus/Hive-compatible routing where possible.
- Keep mortgage compliance constraints visible: rate/quote outputs are estimates, not binding commitments; opt-outs must be honored; borrower data must be protected.
- Use official/authorized CLIs and APIs only. Do not automate around access controls, metering, rate limits, or third-party terms of service.

## Systems involved

Infer from the context above and explicitly account for all systems that touch this category. At minimum, consider Docker/WSL2/Tailscale/Cloudflare, the relevant app/service directories, Infisical secrets, health checks, and downstream agent/webhook consumers.

## What has already been decided

- Strict hostnames are `orchestrator`, `worker-rtx5090`, `worker-rtx3090ti`, `worker-rtx3060`, `oracle-vps`.
- Use additive files/overlays where possible.
- Visual UI/design choices are quarantined unless this prompt explicitly says otherwise.
- Secrets must remain server-side or in secret management.
- Mortgage calculations must be deterministic and validated, not freehand LLM math.
- Campaign automation must stop/pause on replies, STOP/unsubscribe, status transitions, or manual kill switch.

## Assumptions

- The active repo may already contain partial implementations. Inspect before changing.
- If exact service images or versions are unknown, use stable placeholders and document them.
- If a dependency is missing, create a clear scaffold plus README instructions rather than blocking.
- If source material conflicts, use the defaults in `07_conflicts_and_missing_info.md`.

## Do not touch / do not decide

- Do not finalize colors, theme, animation, R3F, shadcn/TweakCN, visual dashboard design, typography, or visual layout.
- Do not delete existing files without explicit instruction.
- Do not expose secrets to client-side code.
- Do not implement bypasses around third-party access controls or terms.

## Exact work to perform

1. Read all completed category prompt outputs.
2. Create a single integrated architecture summary.
3. Identify contradictions between agent outputs and choose safe defaults.
4. Produce a prioritized execution roadmap with exact next repo/file changes.
5. Separate immediate safe tasks from tasks blocked by missing info or UI/design quarantine.
6. Produce a dependency graph.
7. Produce a final commit/PR plan.
8. Produce a smoke test plan for the first integrated deployment.
9. Produce a handoff prompt for the next implementation agent.

## Expected outputs

- Integrated architecture summary.
- Conflict resolution log.
- Dependency graph.
- Next repo/file changes.
- PR/branch plan.
- Smoke test plan.
- Next-agent implementation prompt.

## Acceptance criteria

- The plan is coherent across all systems.
- No UI/design finalization leaks into implementation.
- First implementation task is safe, additive, and valuable.
- Remaining blockers are explicit.
- The next agent can proceed without asking basic questions.

## Edge cases

Document edge cases found during work. Respect opt-outs, secrets, and no-UI-design quarantine.

## Dependencies

None

## Completion report format

When finished, report exactly:

```text
Completed:
Files changed:
Commands run:
Tests run:
Assumptions made:
Conflicts encountered:
Issues found:
Security notes:
Recommended next prompt:
```

## Final instruction

Do not ask clarification questions. Make safe assumptions, document them, and proceed. Produce implementation-grade outputs, not generic advice.
