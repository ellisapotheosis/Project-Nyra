THE MAKE IT WORK FIRST FIELD GUIDE

CORE TRUTH
Defensive code before functionality is theater.
Prove it works. Then protect it.

THE RULES
1. Build the Happy Path First – Code that DOES the thing
2. No Theoretical Defenses – Naked first version
3. Learn from Real Failures – Fix reality, not ghosts
4. Guard Only What Breaks – Add checks only for facts
5. Keep the Engine Visible – Action, not paranoia

ANTI-PATTERNS TO BURN
❌ Fortress Validation
❌ Defensive Exit Theater
❌ Connection State Paranoia

PATTERNS TO LIVE BY
✅ Direct Execution
✅ Natural Failure
✅ Continuous Progress

THE TEST
Can someone grok your code in 10 seconds?
YES → You lived the manifesto
NO  → Delete defenses

THE PROMISE
Readable. Debuggable. Maintainable. Honest.

THE METAPHOR
Don’t bolt on airbags before the engine runs.
First: make it move.
Then: guard against real crashes.

MAKE IT WORK FIRST.
MAKE IT WORK ALWAYS.
GUARDS EARN THEIR KEEP.
